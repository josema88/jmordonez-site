# 6 Things you can do right now to become better software developer

Months ago I was wondering about the journey that I had along my carreer as a software developer and I could say that I’m “lucky” or “blessed” but I don’t trust in luck, I think you build your destiny based on all the decisions that you make. So in these years since I began my journey as a developer I took some decisions and I always been trying to do some things that helped me a lot to improve my skills in this field. I would like to share with you 6 things that I applied and helped me to improve myself. 

## 1. Read Books/magazines/blogs

I'm not a great reader, I have difficulties to focus while I'm reading but I think read is very important. Since I don't have the reading habit I just read some books so far, I'm not the one that reads tons of books but I have to admit that read books help you to grow and learn new things. I'm a person that maybe doesn't reads a lot of books but reads a lot of articles at magazines and blogs, I invest at least 30 minutes every day (I try) reading blogs or articles. This practice helped me to discover new alternatives to do my job, new techs, new frameworks that in some point I've been using and helped me to improve my job. You can start investing some minutes to read about a topic that you want to specialize or a topic that you want to learn. In my case each day I try to read one article about a tech or a stack that I'm familiar with (backend or DevOps) and also I read one article about a tech or stack that I want to learn (frontend and product management).

## 2. Read other's code (specially Open Source projects)

During my career and different jobs I've been working on projects that are already built so I've faced code written by other developers, that was great no matter if that code was bad or well built. Reading other's code you gain new knowdlege, may be you can learn new design patters, code standards and sometimes you learn how not to code.
I also recommend to read the code from Open Source projects, if you use some libraries or tools that you like maybe you can spend some time reading the code and its documentation.


## 3. Develop a personal project

You may have all the theory inside your head but the only way you can prove your value is demonstrating what you've learned. As a Developer build things will help you to improve your skills, in software development the "practice makes perfect". You can develop an App or Tool to learn a new language, framework or design pattern, from my perspective there is no better way to learn than put it in practice. 

## 4. Know Design Patterns (before know a lot programming languages).



## 6. Teach or mentor to others.
