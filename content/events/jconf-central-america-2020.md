Next December 5th I'll be giving a session (in Spanish) called **"Orchestrating immutable infrastructure for test automation with Java, Docker and Selenium Web Driver"**.

There will be speakers from around the world with interesting talks and workshops in Spanish and English.

Let's join this big event organized by Java User Groups from different countries in Central America.
